This provides the guidance in using the code. The configuration file has the following settings.

directory of the source corpus
[Sourcefolder]
source = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\data\source\

directory of the saving the interim data
[Temp_datafolder]
tempdatadir = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\data\interim\

[Reportfolder]
# folder for saving the final reports
Rptfolder = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\reports\
#filepath and filename for saving the evaluation report in csv format
Evalfile = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\data\processed\eval_report.csv


directory for saving the processed file
[Processed_datafolder]
processeddatadir = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\data\processed\


choice of vectorizer to tokenize the text corpus (expected values "CV" for count vectorizer and "TFIDF" for TFIDF algorithm)
[Vectorizer] 
Vect = TFIDF 


THe below parameter lists all the algorithms that are passed as parameters to the model 
[Models]
Model1 = LRL1
Model2 = LRL2
Model3 = NB
Model4 = RF
Model5 = SCKMLP
Model6 = ANNCLF
Modellist = [LogisticRegressionL1, LogisticRegressionL2, MultinomialNB, RandomForest]


folders in which the pickled models need to saved and picked from
[Modelpath]
saveto = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\models\
pickfrom = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\models\


Maximum number of features for the vectorizers. For computational purposes made it as a configurable parameters
[MaxFeatures]
m_features = 10000

Directory structure from which the modelled topic needs to be picked, the model, vectorizer and the topic text corpus for modelling
[TopicModelling]
savemodelledto = C:\Users\nrrvlkp\Documents\M\550\NANDURI_DSC550_FINALPROJECT\reports\
Model = LRL1
Vect = CV
sample_text =  I think the game has been hyped very well.\n\nThe playable demo, the great plateau. There's a lot of footage online but it only reveals the surface of the game. There's still 98% of the game to see.\n\nThe trailer was excellent. Better than most movie trailers. It shows off the main characters and hints at a story but it's still very mysterious.\n\nLaunching with the Switch. This makes it doubly exciting for players like myself. I haven't owned a Nintendo since the GameCube (excluding handhelds) so to get my favorite series and a new console on the same day is going to give me a heart attack.
